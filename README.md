Just another repository

I'm Elisabeth Black.

I teach Horticulture to high school students with special needs. We received a grant to build a Smart Aeroponic Vertical Indoor Garden (SAVInG) and I am here learning to do the Smart part of it. Coding is an important facet of our lives and I have learned recently I need to know how to do it.
