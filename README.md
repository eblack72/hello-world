I'm Elisabeth Black.

I teach Horticulture to high school students with special needs. We received a grant to build a Smart Aeroponic Vertical Indoor Garden (SAVInG) and I am here learning to do the Smart part of it. Coding is an important facet of our lives and I have learned recently I need to know how to do it.

You see in addition to teaching Horticulture I am also a Horticulture Therapist which means I use Horticulture to help people. Part of my plan is to research how Horticulture Activities affect people, specifically by measuring biological functions like blood pressure, heart rate, cortisol levels, and even where possible brain function. My goal is to prove that horticultural therapy relieves anxiety, reduces stress and improves general well being.
